# ML-BLE_RSSI_Bluetooth-Connectivity
BLE Stands for Bluetooth low-energy indoor localization and It aims at high accuracy and precision using radio propagation(spreading the) models and multilateration which are also known as hyperbolic Positioning - "the process of locating an object by accurately computing the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of a signal emitted from the object to three or more receivers"
"Also it is a technique for determining the position of an unknown point"
